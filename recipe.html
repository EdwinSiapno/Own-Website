		<h2>Don't know How to Choose you a car?</h2>
		<br>
		<article>In this page you have a lot of choices.When Car and Driver editors buy cars, emotion often trumps logic. We love performance, so practicality isn’t a major consideration.

It’s a smarter way to buy, but it isn’t any easier. With more than 400 new cars to choose from, how do you pick the right one?

Start by considering a series of questions, but beware: Once you find the car that fulfills your every need, an emotional connection may well form whether you like it or not.</article>
